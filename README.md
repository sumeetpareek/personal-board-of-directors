# personal-board-of-directors

The best way to keep in touch with people who you would trust in times of crisis and celebrations alike.

# What you have to do?

1. Install node.js / npm prerequisites on your machine.
2. `npm install personal-board-of-directors`
3. List down the names of people who would like to keep in the touch in the most _unadulterated form_ in the file `personal-board-of-directors`

# What would this tool do next?

* At a random time, it will email you to talk to a random person from you list.
* A best practice is to reply back to the email after you are done talking with things you talked about.
* If you don't it will email again with a `! ` appended to the subject. Eg: `! ! Mukesh, damn it, pick up the phone and talk to Sumeet` 
* @todo more.. 

# Why are we not calling this "Personal Board of Directors"?

@todo later, I have to run now.

# Tech Stack

100% javascript .. yes, a full 100%

# Next step

Code commit from the @Mukesh-Agarwal, even if it is 0% of functionality. The final product would be ready after 75,000 commits anyway, but we got to begin with one.
